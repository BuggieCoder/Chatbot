They are especially useful when working with command line tools, as they can be used to pass data between different commands.\\n\\nIn this post, we\\'ll look at two types of environment variables: shell variables and pipelines.\\n\\nShell variables are similar to environment variables, but they won\\'t be exported to spawned commands. They are defined with the following syntax:\\n\\n```sh\\nVAR_NAME=value\\n```\\n\\nShell variables can be useful when we want to re-use a value, but don\\'t want it available in any spawned processes.\\n\\nPipelines provide a way to pipe the output of one command to another. For example, the following command pipes the stdout output \"Hello\" to the stdin of the spawned Deno process:\\n\\n```sh\\necho Hello | deno run main.ts\\n```\\n\\nTo pipe stdout and stderr, use `|&` instead:\\n\\n```sh\\ndeno eval \\'console.log(1); console.error(2);\\' |& deno run\\n```\\n\\nUsing environment variables and pipelines together can'}, {'text': '\\n\\nEnvironment variables are a great way to store and access sensitive information in your Deno applications. They can be used to store API keys, passwords, and other sensitive data that you don\\'t want to hard-code into your application.\\n\\nDeno offers built-in support for environment variables with the `Deno.env` object. This object has getter and setter methods that allow you to easily set and retrieve environment variables. For example, you can set a `FIREBASE_API_KEY` environment variable like this:\\n\\n```ts\\nDeno.env.set(\"FIREBASE_API_KEY\", \"examplekey123\");\\n```\\n\\nAnd then retrieve it like this:\\n\\n```ts\\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get(\"FIREBASE_API_KEY\")); // examplekey123\\n```\\n\\nYou can also store environment variables in a `.env` file and access them using the `dotenv` module in the standard library. This is a great way to keep your environment variables separate from your code.\\n\\nTo access the environment variables in the `.env` file, you need to import the `config` function from the'}, {'text': \"\\n\\nEnvironment variables are a powerful tool for managing configuration and settings in your applications. They allow you to store and access values that can be used in your code, and they can be set and changed without having to modify your code.\\n\\nIn Deno, environment variables are defined using the `export` command. For example, to set a variable called `VAR_NAME` to the value `value`, you would use the following command:\\n\\n```sh\\nexport VAR_NAME=value\\n```\\n\\nYou can then access the value of the environment variable in your code using the `Deno.env.get()` method. For example, if you wanted to log the value of the `VAR_NAME` variable, you could use the following code:\\n\\n```js\\nconsole.log(Deno.env.get('VAR_NAME'));\\n```\\n\\nYou can also set environment variables for a single command. To do this, you can list the environment variables before the command, like so:\\n\\n```sh\\nVAR=hello VAR2=bye deno run main.ts\\n```\\n\\nThis will set the environment variables `VAR` and `\"}, {'text': '\\n\\nSetting up your environment is an important part of any development process. Whether you’re working with a language like JavaScript or a framework like Deno, having the right tools and environment variables in place can make a huge difference in the success of your project.\\n\\nDeno is a secure JavaScript and TypeScript runtime that is built on the V8 JavaScript engine. It has a lot of great features, including a full language server to help power your IDE of choice. Installing Deno is all you need to do to make these tools available to you.\\n\\nOutside of using Deno with your favorite IDE, you can also set up shell completions and environment variables. Environment variables are especially important when it comes to Deno, as they can help you customize the runtime and make sure you’re getting the most out of it.\\n\\nSo, what are environment variables? Environment variables are variables that are set in the environment of a program or process. They can be used to customize the behavior of the program or process, and they can also be used to store information that can be used by other programs or processes.\\n\\nIn the case of Deno, environment variables can be used to customize the runtime and make sure you’re'}]\n"
