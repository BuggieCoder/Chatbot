64423. Routine Sampling.
   (a) A public water system shall collect routine bacteriological water samples as follows:
      (1) The minimum number of samples for community water systems shall be based on the known population served or the total number of service connections, whichever results in the greater number of samples, as shown in Table 64423-A;
      (2) The minimum number of samples for nontransient-noncommunity water systems shall be based on the known population served as shown in Table 64423-A during those months when the system is operating;
      (3) The minimum number of samples for transient-noncommunity water systems using only groundwater (not GWUDI) and serving 1000 or fewer persons a month shall be one in each calendar quarter during which the system provides water to the public;
      (4) The minimum number of samples for transient-noncommunity water systems using groundwater (not GWUDI) and serving more than 1000 persons during any month shall be based on the known population served as shown in Table 64423-A.  For any quarter the system serves 1000 or fewer persons in each month and uses only groundwater (not GWUDI), and if the criteria in subsections (c)(2)(A) and (B) are met, the system may submit a request to the State Board to monitor in accordance with paragraph (3).  The request shall include:
         (A) Historical data that demonstrates the system has served 1000 or fewer persons in each month of the calendar quarter for which the request is being made; and
         (B) A revised bacteriological sample siting plan with an updated sampling schedule;
      (5) The minimum number of samples for transient-noncommunity water systems using approved surface water shall be based on the population served as shown in Table 64423-A.  A system using groundwater under the direct influence of surface water shall begin monitoring at this frequency by the end of the sixth month after the State Board has designated the source to be approved surface water;
      (6) The minimum number of samples for seasonal systems, and in lieu of paragraphs (2) through (5), shall be based on the population served as shown in Table 64423-A during those months when the system is operating;
      (7) Samples shall be collected at regular time intervals throughout the month, except that a system using only groundwater (not GWUDI) which serves 4,900 persons or fewer may collect all required samples on a single day if they are taken from different sites;
      (8) At least the minimum number of samples shall be taken even if the system has had an E. coli MCL violation or has exceeded the coliform treatment technique triggers in Section 64426.7; and
      (9) More than the minimum number of samples may be taken provided the samples are included in the bacteriological sample siting plan developed pursuant to Section 64422.

   (b) In addition to the minimum sampling requirements, all public water systems using approved surface water which do not practice filtration in compliance with Sections 64650 through 64666, shall collect a minimum of one sample before or at the first service connection each day during which the turbidity level of the source water exceeds 1 NTU. The sample shall be collected within 24 hours of the first exceedance and shall be analyzed for total coliforms.  If the water system is unable to collect and/or analyze the sample within the 24-hour time period because of extenuating circumstances beyond its control, the system shall notify the State Board within the 24-hour time period, submit a request to the State Board for an extension, and comply with an alternative sample collection schedule specified by the State Board.  Sample results shall be included in determining if the coliform treatment technique trigger in Section 64426.7 has been exceeded.

   (c) A transient-noncommunity water system monitoring pursuant to subsection (a)(3):
      (1) Shall, in the month following the occurrence of any of the following events, increase monitoring to one sample each month:
         (A) The system triggers a Level 2 assessment or two Level 1 assessments in a rolling12-month period;
         (B) The system has an E. coli MCL violation;

         (D) The system has two bacteriological monitoring violations or one bacteriological monitoring violation and one Level 1 assessment in a rolling 12-month period.  For purposes of this subparagraph, failure to conduct bacteriological monitoring under Section 64423, 64423.1, 64424, or 64425 is a bacteriological monitoring violation;
      (2) If monitoring pursuant to paragraph (1) and if all the following criteria are met, may submit a request to the State Board to return to routine monitoring pursuant to subsection (a)(3):
         (A) Within the last 12 consecutive months, the system shall have a completed sanitary survey, site visit, or voluntary Level 2 assessment by the State Board and be determined by the State Board to be free of sanitary defects and have a protected water source; and
         (B) Immediately prior to the request, the system shall have a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12 consecutive months; and
      (3) Shall, in the month following one or more total coliform-positive samples (with or without a Level 1 treatment technique trigger exceedance), collect at least three routine samples.  The system may either collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month or may collect all required routine samples on a single day if samples are taken from different sites.  If the system stops supplying water during the month following the total coliform-positive(s), at least three routine samples shall be collected during the first month the system resumes operation.
      
   (d) A public water system in violation of the routine sample monitoring requirements of this section shall notify the State Board within 10 days after it learns of the violation and notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.

   (e) A public water system in violation of the reporting requirement in subsection (d) to notify the State Board shall notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.

64423.1. Sample Analysis and Reporting of Results.
   (a) A public water system shall designate (label) each sample as routine, repeat, replacement, or other pursuant to Section 64421(b), and have each sample analyzed for total coliforms.  The system also shall require the laboratory to analyze the same sample for Escherichia coli (E. coli) whenever the presence of total coliforms is indicated. As a minimum, the analytical results shall be reported in terms of the presence or absence of total coliforms and E. coli in the sample, whichever is appropriate.  If directed by the State Board, based on an identified sanitary defect, exceedance of a Level 1 or Level 2 coliform treatment technique trigger, history of total coliform-positive samples within the past 12 consecutive months, or determination of a possible significant rise in bacterial count in accordance with Section 64426, the analytical results shall be reported in terms of coliform density of total coliforms and E. coli, in the sample, whichever is appropriate.

   (b) A public water system shall require the laboratory to notify the system within 24 hours, whenever the presence of total coliforms or E. coli is demonstrated in a sample or a sample is invalidated due to interference problems, pursuant to Section 64425(b), ensure that a contact person is available to receive these analytical results 24-hours a day, and provide the name(s) and contact information of the contact person(s) to the laboratory.  The system shall also require the laboratory to immediately notify the State Board of any positive bacteriological results if the laboratory cannot make direct contact with the designated contact person within 24 hours.
   
   (c) Analytical results of all required samples collected for a public water system in a calendar month shall be reported to the State Board not later than the tenth day of the following month, as follows:  
      (1) Systems serving more than 400 service connections or 1000 persons, or a wholesaler as defined in section 64402.20(a), shall submit a monthly summary of the bacteriological monitoring results to the State Board, which shall contain the following: 
         (A) Total number of samples collected; 
         (B) Number, sample collection date, and sample location of all total coliform and E. coli-positive samples;
         (C) Number, sample collection date, sample location, and result of triggered groundwater source samples collected; and
         (D) Sample collection date, sample location, and result for all repeat samples collected.
      (2) Systems serving fewer than 10,000 service connections shall require the laboratory to submit copies of all required bacteriological monitoring results directly to the State Board; and 
      (3) Systems serving 10,000 or more service connections shall require the laboratory to submit copies of bacteriological monitoring results for all positive routine samples and all repeat samples directly to the State Board.  

   (d) A public water system in violation of the monitoring requirement of subsection (a) to test the same sample for E. coli following a total coliform-positive routine sample shall notify the State Board within 10 days after it learns of the violation and shall notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.
   
   (e) A public water system in violation of the reporting requirement of subsection (c) to report monitoring results to the State Board or subsection (d) to notify the State Board shall notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.
   
64424. Repeat Sampling.
   (a) If a routine sample is total coliform-positive, a public water system shall collect a repeat sample set as described in paragraph (1) within 24 hours of being notified of the positive result.  The repeat samples shall all be collected within the same 24-hour time period.  A single service connection system may submit a request to the State Board to allow the collection of the repeat sample set over a three-day period. 
      (1) A repeat sample set shall be at least three samples for each total coliform-positive sample. 
      (2) If the system is unable to collect the samples within the 24-hour time period specified in subsection (a) or deliver the samples to the laboratory within 24 hours after collection because of circumstances beyond its control, the system shall notify the State Board within 24 hours.  The State Board will then determine how much time the system will have to collect the repeat samples.  

   (b) Unless the condition for using alternative sampling locations or dual purpose sampling locations in Table 64424-A or B, respectively, is met, when collecting the repeat sample set, a public water system shall collect at least one repeat sample from the sampling tap where the original total coliform-positive sample was taken. Other repeat samples shall be collected within five service connections upstream or downstream of the original site. At least one sample shall be from upstream and one from downstream unless there is no upstream and/or downstream service connection. If a total coliform-positive sample is at the end of the distribution system, or one service connection away from the end of the distribution system, the system shall still take all required repeat samples.  The system may submit a request to the State Board to use an alternative sampling location in lieu of the requirement to collect at least one repeat sample upstream or downstream of the original sampling site.  Except as provided in Table 64424-B, a system required to conduct triggered source water monitoring under 40 CFR 141.402(a), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430, shall take groundwater (not GWUDI) source sample(s) in addition to repeat samples required under this section.  If monitoring pursuant to Table 64424-B and in violation of the E. coli MCL, the system shall comply with the additional Ground Water Rule requirements in Table 64424-C.

The system shall comply with 40 CFR 141.402(a)(3), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430.  If the system takes more than one repeat sample at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring, the system may reduce the number of additional source water samples required under 40 CFR 141.402(a)(3), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430, by the number of repeat samples taken at that location that were not E. coli-positive.

A system takes more than one repeat sample at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring and more than one repeat sample is E. coli-positive

The system shall comply with 40 CFR 141.403(a)(1), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430.

All repeat samples taken at the monitoring location required for triggered source water monitoring are E. coli-negative and a repeat sample taken at a monitoring location other than the one required for triggered source water monitoring is E.coli-positive

The system is not required to comply with 40 CFR 141.402(a)(3), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430.


(c) If one or more samples in the repeat sample set is total coliform-positive, a public water system shall collect and have analyzed an additional set of repeat samples as specified in subsections (a) and (b).  The system shall repeat this process until either no total coliforms are detected in one complete repeat sample set or the system determines that a coliform treatment technique trigger specified in Section 64426.7 has been exceeded as a result of a repeat sample being total coliform-positive and notifies the State Board by the end of the day on which this is determined.  If a treatment technique trigger identified in Section 64426.7 is exceeded as a result of a routine sample being total coliform-positive, the system is required to conduct only one round of repeat monitoring for each total coliform-positive routine sample.

   (d) A public water system in violation of the repeat sample monitoring requirements of this section shall notify the State Board within 10 days after it learns of the violation and notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.

   (e) A public water system in violation of the reporting requirement in subsection (d) to notify the State Board shall notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.
   
64425. Sample Invalidation.
   (a) A public water system may request the State Board to invalidate a routine or repeat sample for which a total coliform-positive result has been reported if the system demonstrates:
      (1) All repeat sample(s) collected at the same tap as the original total coliform-positive sample also are total coliform- positive and all repeat samples collected within five service connections of the original tap are not total coliform-positive; or  
      (2) The laboratory did not follow the prescribed analytical methods pursuant to Section 64415(a), based on a review of laboratory documentation by the State Board.  The system shall submit to the State Board a written request for invalidation along with the laboratory documentation, the system's sample collection records and any observations noted during sample collection and delivery.  The system shall require the laboratory to provide the system with documentation which shall include, but not be limited to:  
         (A) A letter from the director of the laboratory having generated the data, confirming the invalidation request by reason of laboratory accident or error; 
         (B) Complete sample identification, laboratory sample log number (if used), date and time of collection, date and time of receipt by the laboratory, date and time of analysis for the sample(s) in question;  
         (C) Complete description of the accident or error alleged to have invalidated the result(s);
         (D) Copies of all analytical, operating, and quality assurance records pertaining to the incident in question; and  
         (E) Any observations noted by laboratory personnel when receiving and analyzing the sample(s) in question.  

   (b) Whenever any total coliform routine or repeat sample result indicative of the absence of total coliforms has been declared invalid by the laboratory due to interference problems as specified at 40 Code Federal Regulations, Section 141.853(c)(2) (78 Fed. Reg. 10270 (February 13, 2013)), which is incorporated by reference, the public water system shall collect a replacement sample from the same location as the original sample within 24 hours of being notified of the interference problem, and have it analyzed for the presence of total coliforms.  The system shall continue to re-sample at the original site within 24 hours and have the samples analyzed until a valid result is obtained.  If the system is unable to collect the sample within the 24-hour time period or deliver the sample to the laboratory within 24 hours after collection because of circumstances beyond its control, the system shall notify the State Board within 24 hours.  The State Board will then determine how much time the system will have to collect the replacement sample.

   (c) A total coliform-positive sample invalidated under this section does not count towards meeting the minimum routine and repeat sample monitoring requirements of Sections 64423 and 64424, respectively.
   
   (d) A public water system in violation of the replacement sample monitoring requirements of subsection (b) shall notify the State Board within 10 days after it learns of the violation and notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.
