CHAPTER 15. DOMESTIC WATER QUALITY AND MONITORING REGULATIONS 

Article 3. Primary Standards--Bacteriological Quality
64421. General Requirements.
   (a) The requirements of this Article apply to public water systems.

   (b) In addition to the bacteriological monitoring requirements in Sections 64423, 64424, 64425, and 64426.9, a public water system shall perform special purpose bacteriological monitoring as follows: 
      (1) After any system pressure loss to less than five psi.  Samples collected shall represent the water quality in the affected portions of the system; and
		(2) For a groundwater (not GWUDI) source that is treated with a primary or residual disinfectant on a continuous basis and is not monitored pursuant to Section 64654.8(b)(1)(B): 
         (A) A raw water sample shall be collected each calendar quarter, with samples collected during the same month (first, second, or third) of each calendar quarter; and
         (B) If the raw water sample is total coliform-positive, a raw water sample shall be collected each month.  If no coliforms are detected for a minimum of three consecutive months, a public water system may submit a request to the State Board to monitor in accordance with subparagraph (A).

   (c) A public water system shall maintain documentation that the personnel performing sample collection and/or field tests under this Article have been trained pursuant to Section 64415(b).  As a minimum, the documentation shall include the name and qualifications of the personnel who will be performing the sample collection and/or field tests.
   
   (d) Plans, procedures, and requests to be submitted by a public water system to the State Board under this Article shall be in writing.  For a request, the system shall state what is being requested, the basis for the request, and include any documentation to support the request.

64422. Bacteriological Sample Siting Plan.
   (a) By October 1, 2021, an existing public water system shall develop and submit to the State Board a bacteriological sample siting plan that identifies sampling sites and a sample collection schedule for the collection of bacteriological samples for total coliform analysis, subject to the following: 
      (1) The sample sites chosen shall be representative of water throughout the distribution system including each pressure zone, and areas supplied by each water source and distribution reservoir; 
      (2) Routine sampling may be rotated among the routine sample sites if the total number of sites needed to comply with paragraph (1) above exceeds the number of samples required according to Table 64423-A.  The rotation of sampling sites shall be described in the plan; 
		(3) Routine and repeat sampling may take place at a customers premises, dedicated sampling station, or other designated compliance sample location;
		(4) The physical location of routine and repeat sample sites and sampling points required by the Ground Water Rule (triggered source monitoring and assessment source monitoring) in Section 64430 shall be specified in the plan; and
		(5) If applicable, the alternative sampling locations, dual purpose sampling locations, and special purpose sampling locations required in Table 64424-A,Table 64424-B, and Section 64421(b)(2), respectively, shall be specified in the plan.

   (b) A public water system shall collect bacteriological samples for total coliform analysis in accordance with the State Board-approved bacteriological sample siting plan.
   
   (c) A public water system shall submit an updated plan to the State Board at least once every ten years and within 30 days of the systems or State Boards determination that the plan no longer complies with subsection (a), the alternative monitoring location for repeat samples collected under Table 64424-A is no longer representative of a pathway for contamination of the distribution system, or dual purpose sampling specified in Table 64424-B is no longer representative of water quality in the distribution system.

64423. Routine Sampling.
   (a) A public water system shall collect routine bacteriological water samples as follows:
      (1) The minimum number of samples for community water systems shall be based on the known population served or the total number of service connections, whichever results in the greater number of samples, as shown in Table 64423-A;
      (2) The minimum number of samples for nontransient-noncommunity water systems shall be based on the known population served as shown in Table 64423-A during those months when the system is operating;
      (3) The minimum number of samples for transient-noncommunity water systems using only groundwater (not GWUDI) and serving 1000 or fewer persons a month shall be one in each calendar quarter during which the system provides water to the public;
      (4) The minimum number of samples for transient-noncommunity water systems using groundwater (not GWUDI) and serving more than 1000 persons during any month shall be based on the known population served as shown in Table 64423-A.  For any quarter the system serves 1000 or fewer persons in each month and uses only groundwater (not GWUDI), and if the criteria in subsections (c)(2)(A) and (B) are met, the system may submit a request to the State Board to monitor in accordance with paragraph (3).  The request shall include:
         (A) Historical data that demonstrates the system has served 1000 or fewer persons in each month of the calendar quarter for which the request is being made; and
         (B) A revised bacteriological sample siting plan with an updated sampling schedule;
      (5) The minimum number of samples for transient-noncommunity water systems using approved surface water shall be based on the population served as shown in Table 64423-A.  A system using groundwater under the direct influence of surface water shall begin monitoring at this frequency by the end of the sixth month after the State Board has designated the source to be approved surface water;
      (6) The minimum number of samples for seasonal systems, and in lieu of paragraphs (2) through (5), shall be based on the population served as shown in Table 64423-A during those months when the system is operating;
      (7) Samples shall be collected at regular time intervals throughout the month, except that a system using only groundwater (not GWUDI) which serves 4,900 persons or fewer may collect all required samples on a single day if they are taken from different sites;
      (8) At least the minimum number of samples shall be taken even if the system has had an E. coli MCL violation or has exceeded the coliform treatment technique triggers in Section 64426.7; and
      (9) More than the minimum number of samples may be taken provided the samples are included in the bacteriological sample siting plan developed pursuant to Section 64422.

   (b) In addition to the minimum sampling requirements, all public water systems using approved surface water which do not practice filtration in compliance with Sections 64650 through 64666, shall collect a minimum of one sample before or at the first service connection each day during which the turbidity level of the source water exceeds 1 NTU. The sample shall be collected within 24 hours of the first exceedance and shall be analyzed for total coliforms.  If the water system is unable to collect and/or analyze the sample within the 24-hour time period because of extenuating circumstances beyond its control, the system shall notify the State Board within the 24-hour time period, submit a request to the State Board for an extension, and comply with an alternative sample collection schedule specified by the State Board.  Sample results shall be included in determining if the coliform treatment technique trigger in Section 64426.7 has been exceeded.

   (c) A transient-noncommunity water system monitoring pursuant to subsection (a)(3):
      (1) Shall, in the month following the occurrence of any of the following events, increase monitoring to one sample each month:
         (A) The system triggers a Level 2 assessment or two Level 1 assessments in a rolling12-month period;
         (B) The system has an E. coli MCL violation;
         (C) The system has a coliform treatment technique violation; or
         (D) The system has two bacteriological monitoring violations or one bacteriological monitoring violation and one Level 1 assessment in a rolling 12-month period.  For purposes of this subparagraph, failure to conduct bacteriological monitoring under Section 64423, 64423.1, 64424, or 64425 is a bacteriological monitoring violation;
      (2) If monitoring pursuant to paragraph (1) and if all the following criteria are met, may submit a request to the State Board to return to routine monitoring pursuant to subsection (a)(3):
         (A) Within the last 12 consecutive months, the system shall have a completed sanitary survey, site visit, or voluntary Level 2 assessment by the State Board and be determined by the State Board to be free of sanitary defects and have a protected water source; and
         (B) Immediately prior to the request, the system shall have a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12 consecutive months; and
      (3) Shall, in the month following one or more total coliform-positive samples (with or without a Level 1 treatment technique trigger exceedance), collect at least three routine samples.  The system may either collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month or may collect all required routine samples on a single day if samples are taken from different sites.  If the system stops supplying water during the month following the total coliform-positive(s), at least three routine samples shall be collected during the first month the system resumes operation.
      
   (d) A public water system in violation of the routine sample monitoring requirements of this section shall notify the State Board within 10 days after it learns of the violation and notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.

   (e) A public water system in violation of the reporting requirement in subsection (d) to notify the State Board shall notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.
