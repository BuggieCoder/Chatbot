For any quarter the system serves 1000 or fewer persons in each month and uses only groundwater (not GWUDI), and if the criteria in subsections (c)(2)(A) and (B) are met, the system may submit a request to the State Board to monitor in accordance with paragraph (3). The request shall include:\n",

        "(B) A revised bacteriological sample siting plan with an updated sampling schedule;\n",
        "(5) The minimum number of samples for transient-noncommunity water systems using approved surface water shall be based on the population served as shown in Table 64423-A. A system using groundwater under the direct influence of surface water shall begin monitoring at this frequency by the end of the sixth month after the State Board has designated the source to be approved surface water;\n",

For purposes of this subparagraph, failure to conduct bacteriological monitoring under Section 64423, 64423.1, 64424, or 64425 is a bacteriological monitoring violation;\n",
        "(2) If monitoring pursuant to paragraph (1) and if all the following criteria are met, may submit a request to the State Board to return to routine monitoring pursuant to subsection (a)(3):\n",
        "(A) Within the last 12 consecutive months, the system shall have a completed sanitary survey, site visit, or voluntary Level 2 assessment by the State Board and be determined by the State Board to be free of sanitary defects and have a protected water source; and\n",
        "(B) Immediately prior to the request, the system shall have a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12 consecutive months; and\n",
        "(3) Shall, in the month following one or more total coliform-positive samples (with or without a Level 1 treatment technique trigger exceedance), collect at least three routine samples. The system may either collect samples at regular time intervals throughout the month or may collect all required routine samples on a single day if samples are taken from different sites.

The system shall also require the laboratory to immediately notify the State Board of any positive bacteriological results if the laboratory cannot make direct contact with the designated contact person within 24 hours.\n",

A single service connection system may submit a request to the State Board to allow the collection of the repeat sample set over a three-day period.\n",
