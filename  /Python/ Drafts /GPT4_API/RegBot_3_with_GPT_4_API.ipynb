The system also shall require the laboratory to analyze the same sample for Escherichia coli (E. coli) whenever the presence of total coliforms is indicated. As a minimum, the analytical results shall be reported in terms of the presence or absence of total coliforms and E. coli, in the sample, whichever is appropriate. If directed by the State Board, based on an identified sanitary defect, exceedance of a Level 1 or Level 2 coliform treatment technique trigger, history of total coliform-positive samples within the past 12 consecutive months, or determination of a possible significant rise in bacterial count in accordance with Section 64426, the analytical results shall be reported in terms of coliform density of total coliforms and E. coli, in the sample, whichever is appropriate.\n",
        "(b) A public water system shall require the laboratory to notify the system within 24 hours, whenever the presence of total coliform or E. coli is demonstrated in a sample or a sample is invalidated due to interference problems, pursuant to Section 64425(b), ensure that a contact person is available to receive these analytical results 24-hours a day, and provide the name(s) and contact information of the contact person(s) to the laboratory. The system shall also require the laboratory to immediately notify the State Board of any positive bacteriological results if the laboratory cannot make direct contact with the designated contact person within 24 hours.\n",
        "(c) Analytical results of all required samples collected for a public water system in a calendar month shall be reported to the State Board not later than the tenth day of the following month, as follows:\n",

        "(3) Systems serving 10,000 or more service connections shall require the laboratory to submit copies of bacteriological monitoring results for all positive routine samples and all repeat samples directly to the State Board.\n",
        "(d) A public water system in violation of the monitoring requirement of subsection (a) to test the same sample for E. coli following a total coliform-positive routine sample shall notify the State Board within 10 days after it learns of the violation and shall notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.\n",

The repeat samples shall all be collected within the same 24-hour time period. A single service connection system may submit a request to the State Board to allow the collection of the repeat sample set over a three-day period.\n",
        "(1) A repeat sample set shall be at least three samples for each total coliform-positive sample.\n",
        "(2) If the system is unable to collect the samples within the 24-hour time period specified in subsection (a) or deliver the samples to the laboratory within 24 hours after collection because of circumstances beyond its control, the system shall notify the State Board within 24 hours. The State Board will then determine how much time the system will have to collect the repeat samples.\n",
        "(b) Unless the condition for using alternative sampling locations or dual purpose sampling locations in Table 64424-A or B, respectively, is met, when collecting the repeat sample set, a public water system shall collect at least one repeat sample from the sampling tap where the original total coliform-positive sample was taken. Other repeat samples shall be collected within five service connections upstream or downstream of the original site. At least one sample shall be from upstream and one from downstream unless there is no upstream and/or downstream service connection. If a total coliform-positive sample is at the end of the distribution system, or one service connection away from the end of the distribution system, the system shall still take all required repeat samples. The system may submit a request to the State Board to use an alternative sampling location in lieu of the requirement to collect at least one repeat sample upstream or downstream of the original sampling site. Except as provided in Table 64424-B, a system required to conduct triggered source water monitoring under 40 CFR 141.402(a), which is incorporated by reference under Section 64430, shall take groundwater (not GWUDI) source sample(s) in addition to repeat samples required under this section. If monitoring pursuant to Table 64424-B and in violation of the E. coli MCL, the system shall comply with the additional Ground Water Rule requirements in Table 64424-C.\n",
        "(c) If one or more samples in the repeat sample set is total coliform-positive, a public water system shall collect and have analyzed an additional set of repeat samples as specified in subsections (a) and (b). The system shall repeat this process until either no total coliforms are detected in one complete repeat sample set or the system determines that a coliform treatment technique trigger specified in Section 64426.7 has been exceeded as a result of a repeat sample being total coliform-positive and notifies the State Board by the end of the day on which this is determined. If a treatment technique trigger identified in Section 64426.7 is exceeded as a result of a routine sample being total coliform-positive, the system is required to conduct only one round of repeat monitoring for each total coliform-positive routine sample.\n",
        "(d) A public water system in violation of the repeat sample monitoring requirements of this section shall notify the State Board within 10 days after it learns of the violation and notify the public pursuant to Sections 64463, 64463.7, and 64465.\n",
