Article 3. Primary Standards--Bacteriological Quality,§64421. General Requirements,(a) The requirements of this Article apply to public water systems.,
Article 3. Primary Standards--Bacteriological Quality,§64421. General Requirements,"(b) In addition to the bacteriological monitoring requirements in Sections 64423, 64424, 64425, and 64426.9, a public water system shall perform special purpose bacteriological monitoring as follows: 
(1) After any system pressure loss to less than five psi.  Samples collected shall represent the water quality in the affected portions of the system; and
		(2) For a groundwater (not GWUDI) source that is treated with a primary or residual disinfectant on a continuous basis and is not monitored pursuant to Section 64654.8(b)(1)(B): 
(A) A raw water sample shall be collected each calendar quarter, with samples collected during the same month (first, second, or third) of each calendar quarter; and
(B) If the raw water sample is total coliform-positive, a raw water sample shall be collected each month.  If no coliforms are detected for a minimum of three consecutive months, a public water system may submit a request to the State Board to monitor in accordance with subparagraph (A).",
Article 3. Primary Standards--Bacteriological Quality,§64421. General Requirements,"(c) A public water system shall maintain documentation that the personnel performing sample collection and/or field tests under this Article have been trained pursuant to Section 64415(b).  As a minimum, the documentation shall include the name and qualifications of the personnel who will be performing the sample collection and/or field tests.",
Article 3. Primary Standards--Bacteriological Quality,§64421. General Requirements,"(d) Plans, procedures, and requests to be submitted by a public water system to the State Board under this Article shall be in writing.  For a request, the system shall state what is being requested, the basis for the request, and include any documentation to support the request.",
Article 3. Primary Standards--Bacteriological Quality,§64422. Bacteriological Sample Siting Plan.,"(a) By October 1, 2021, an existing public water system shall develop and submit to 
the State Board a bacteriological sample siting plan that identifies sampling sites and a 
sample collection schedule for the collection of bacteriological samples for total coliform 
analysis, subject to the following: 
      (1) The sample sites chosen shall be representative of water throughout the 
distribution system including each pressure zone, and areas supplied by each water 
source and distribution reservoir; 
      (2) Routine sampling may be rotated among the routine sample sites if the total 
number of sites needed to comply with paragraph (1) above exceeds the number of 
samples required according to Table 64423-A.  The rotation of sampling sites shall be 
described in the plan; 
		(3) Routine and repeat sampling may take place at a customer’s premises, 
dedicated sampling station, or other designated compliance sample location;
		(4) The physical location of routine and repeat sample sites and sampling points 
required by the Ground Water Rule (triggered source monitoring and assessment 
source monitoring) in Section 64430 shall be specified in the plan; and
		(5) If applicable, the alternative sampling locations, dual purpose sampling 
locations, and special purpose sampling locations required in Table 64424-A,Table 
64424-B, and Section 64421(b)(2), respectively, shall be specified in the plan.",
Article 3. Primary Standards--Bacteriological Quality,§64422. Bacteriological Sample Siting Plan.,(b) A public water system shall collect bacteriological samples for total coliform analysis in accordance with the State Board-approved bacteriological sample siting plan.,
Article 3. Primary Standards--Bacteriological Quality,§64422. Bacteriological Sample Siting Plan.,"(c) A public water system shall submit an updated plan to the State Board at least 
once every ten years and within 30 days of the system’s or State Board’s determination 
that the plan no longer complies with subsection (a), the alternative monitoring location 
for repeat samples collected under Table 64424-A is no longer representative of a 
pathway for contamination of the distribution system, or dual purpose sampling 
specified in Table 64424-B is no longer representative of water quality in the distribution 
system.",
